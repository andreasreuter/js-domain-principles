# JS Domain Principles

With this incredible domain-driven design toolkit, you can easily start coding with these principles. I recommend to read further literature [Khalil Stemmler: Domain-Driven Design](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/categories/domain-driven-design) and my [Medium bookmarks](https://medium.com/@AndiReuter/list/domain-driven-design-b4ec21b36221).

# Say Hello

Hi, my name is Andi. I work as a Freelancing and Contract developer | Swift / iOS, macOS, GraphQL, Google Cloud and NodeJS for more than 13+ years ðŸ‘‹,

I actively maintain this toolkit. :rocket:

I love to share this well developed domain-driven design toolkit with you. You can use it whenever you want for free to develop an incredibly clean code structure.

I'm happy to share my domain-driven design knowledge with you. You can contact me at any time [contact@andireuter.com](mailto:contact@andireuter.com?subject=JS%20Domain%20Principles).
